Python Real‑Life Practice Programs

This project contains simple Python programs based on real‑world situations. It is designed for beginners to practice basic programming concepts like functions, lists, dictionaries, conditions, and loops.

Each program solves a small practical problem such as shopping cart calculation, menu management, student performance tracking, seat booking, patient search, feedback analysis, and taxi fare calculation.

Programs Included

E‑Commerce Cart System
Calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart. If there are more than 5 items, a 10% discount is applied. It also handles empty carts.

Restaurant Menu Management
Allows adding new food items, removing items, and checking whether a particular dish is available in the menu.

Classroom Performance Tracker
Calculates the average marks of each student and finds the top performer based on highest average.

Movie Ticket Booking System
Manages cinema seats by allowing booking and cancellation while preventing double booking of the same seat.

Hospital Patient Management
Stores patient details and allows searching patients based on a specific disease.

Customer Feedback Analysis
Analyzes customer ratings and calculates the percentage of positive feedback (ratings 4 or 5).

Taxi Fare Calculation
Computes taxi fare for multiple trips using a base fare and distance‑based charges, and shows the total fare.
